# Plate Number Checker for QPython

This script is made because it requires too many steps to just check the current status of plate number for booking (in Thailand). Thanks to QPython, `BeautifulSoup` and `requests` to make this script possible. Also thanks to [this blog](https://realpython.com/blog/python/python-web-scraping-practical-introduction/) for working functions for scraping website.
